30720,Examining protein: protein interactions in cellular membranes relevant to the treatment of human diseases,"Dr. Andrews has worked to understand an unusual class of membrane-binding proteins, the Bcl-2 family, that were shown to cause cancer, not by causing cellular growth, but by preventing programmed cellular death. This discovery caused a paradigm shift in cancer biology and interest in regulated apoptosis exploded. It is now apparent that the Bcl-2 protein family regulates the response of tumour cells to chemotherapy by altering their own binding interactions. 

The Bcl-2-mediated interactions depend on where the proteins interact in part because the structural changes resulting from membrane insertion lead to dramatic changes in interacting partners. Thus it is challenging to extrapolate measurements of binding interactions conventionally made in vitro using truncated proteins to what happens in live cells. Furthermore, there are few approaches that can be used to study protein:protein interactions in membranes in vitro and even less for studies in live cells.  Dr. Andrews has developed fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence imaging spectroscopy methods to examine them, respectively. These new techniques are now being used by pharmaceutical companies to make new anti-cancer drugs to improve chemotherapy. The infrastructure requested includes core and ancillary equipment required to perform these techniques at an internationally competitive level.

C-056-2422585-MARTIN,Clinical Research on the Therapeutic Benefits of Annexin A5 in Severe COVID-19 Patients,"There are currently no proven therapies to treat COVID-19. In the most severe cases, the disease is complicated by sepsis acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiorgan failure. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to an infection. While the body normally releases chemicals to fight an infection, sepsis occurs when the body's response to these chemicals is out of balance, triggering systemic inflammation that can damage multiple organs. Many critically ill COVID-19 patients develop sepsis 1-2 days before ARDS, suggesting that sepsis is a major contributor to the development of organ and respiratory failure. 

 This clinical trial will examine the effects of Annexin A5, in treating critically ill COVID-19 patients who develop sepsis. Annexin A5 is a human protein that has potent anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic (cell death prevention) and moderate anticoagulant (blood clot prevention) properties. The ultimate goal of the trial is to use Annexin A5 to treat sepsis and prevent respiratory and multi-organ failure.

More than 40% of early childhood hearing loss presents as mild bilateral or unilateral hearing loss and is considered ""minimal"".  However, there is strong evidence that many children with minimal loss experience difficulties at school. Prior to UNHS, these children were late-identified (age five years) and little is known about the consequences of minimal loss or preferred interventions when identified in infancy.  This study will examine outcomes at early school-age through standardized measures and parent perspectives.

The attention network is composed of those cells that represent that stimulus, which is most relevant for the organism. The same network hosts mechanisms to prevent attention to be distracted by irrelevant, intruding stimuli or thoughts.  
 
Our research aims to unravel the cell mechanisms that identify the relevance of stimuli before we attend to them, and that prevent distraction from irrelevant stimuli â€“ measuring multiple cell activities in the nonhuman primate prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia.

","Antisocial behaviour problems in adolescents pose major social and health burdens on individuals, their families, and Canadian society. Thus, effectively preventing aggression is of critical importance. Research indicates that moral development serves as crucial protective factor against aggression. The proposed research will implement and evaluate an innovative intervention study using a curriculum that promotes morality. This knowledge is likely to contribute to new evidence on what works in the promotion of mental health and the reduction of aggression in early adolescents. It will also create a system that can be used in schools and afterschool programs across Ontario.",Advanced health technologies,Early Researcher Awards - Round 008,13-Mar-12,Early Researcher Awards,University of Toronto,Toronto,"$140,000","$190,000",,Operating,Tina,Malti

Many strategies have been proposed to address falls. However, environmental changes have the potential to impact fall rates on a population level, because these risk factors are amenable to correction and do not require modifications in individual behavior or physical function. Although such environmental changes can occur through modifications to building codes and standards, guidance towards changes to building features is limited considering older adults with and without impairment. Thus, high fall risk remains. This proposed research uses biomechanical evaluation to understand how individuals interact with environmental features during normal activities and in response to slips or missteps. Knowledge generated will provide insight into the impact of environmental design on fall risk reduction.

The diagnosis of CI in lupus is delayed and its monitoring is poor. This proposal identifies a shortfall of the Ontario Health Insurance Plan by not covering the cost of the recommended battery of tests required to diagnose CI. Currently the battery of tests are time consuming, costly to patients (~$1500.00) and require specialists to administer. Therefore, it is important to identify tools that are cost and time efficient for Ontarioâ€™s lupus population.

ER18-14-158,Aging and associative memory: Neural mechanisms and implications for everyday life,"A primary concern of many older adults is that their memory is slipping. While there is some evidence to support this concern, it seems that memory processes themselves may not be the primary culprit. My work has shown that age differences in attention, or the ability to focus on relevant information and block out distraction, can give the impression that memory declines with age. Older adults pick-up on more distracting information and this can interfere with memory. What remains unclear is (i) how this distracting information is encoded in the brain, and (ii) does it also affect memory for events in everyday life? The proposed research will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye-tracking to address these questions. This work will not only contribute to the skill base of the Ontario workforce, but has the potential to create actionable advice for Ontario seniors hoping to maintain good cognitive health.",Advanced Health Technologies,Early Researcher Awards - Round 014,26-Mar-19,Early Researcher Awards,Brock University,St. Catharines,"$140,000","$190,000","aging, memory, attention, cognition, fMRI, eye-tracking, effective connectivity, dynamic causal modeling",Operating,Karen,Campbell

With twenty-seven bones forming thirty-three distinct joints and surrounded by a network of supporting muscles and ligaments, it has been difficult to understand how the foot manages trade-offs between mobility and stability. Recent advances in 3D x-ray imaging provide can now measure the foot's complex function during walking and running. The purpose of this research is to examine whether the current, largely untested, models of foot function are sufficient or if new models are required. In this proposal we will measure foot mechanics using high-speed x-ray and ultrasound imaging to examine foot function during barefoot and shod activities. This work will provide fundamental information necessary to design more effective footwear, prosthetics, and orthotics for Ontarians.

Let-7a is also known to play a role in cancer development. Until now, researchers explored inhibitors of the pathological state of both microRNA let-7a and Akt1 metabolism. We now realize Akt1 and let-7a metabolism are tightly connected. We found that elevated Akt1 activity controls let-7a activity and vice versa. Our research aims to identify the mechanistic basis of the feedback loop between microRNAs and Akt1 signaling. We already identified a new cellular effect of two FDA-approved drugs that regulate oncogenic kinase activity by altering microRNA metabolism.

The suboptimal management of children's pain in acute care settings has short and long-term consequences is well described. Children rate IV placement as one of the most painful in-hospital experiences. Owing to age-related technical difficulties, multiple IV attempts are often needed. This consumes time and resources and poses a challenge to nurses' self-perception as alleviators of pain. Moreover, families are often uprooted as children may be transported long distances to tertiary care centers to facilitate IV placement. We aim to demonstrate that intranasal (IN) ketamine is no less effective that IV ketamine. This will provide an approach that is less painful and less invasive.

Climate change due to infrared radiation-trapping gases necessitates immediate mitigation strategies. Algal blooms, particularly in Lake Erie, are associated with excess discharge of phosphates. These problems not only cause environmental damage/deterioration, but they generate economic losses in Ontario (such as soil erosion and nutrient losses from agricultural soils). The focus of this research is to develop an engineered fertilizer that can simultaneously address these two environmental challenges of Ontario, and also be economically feasible. A mineral-amended coating will be applied to traditional fertilizers to control fertilizer release. The aim is to change the carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) cycles in the soil to achieve permanent sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere, reducing ammonia, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from soil, and retaining phosphates in soil in a plant-available, but erosion/washout resistant, form.",Bio-economy and clean technologies,Early Researcher Awards - Round 014,26-Mar-19,Early Researcher Awards,University of Guelph,Guelph,"$140,000","$190,000","Atmospheric CO2 capture, alkaline minerals, coated fertilizer, phosphate runoff, nitrogen emission, geochemical modelling, chemical speciation, agricultural soils",Operating,Emily ,Chiang

Studies demonstrating the presence of microplastics in freshwater rivers, lakes and in atmospheric deposition have shown that microplastics are not just ocean contaminants, and thus extend beyond the realm of marine science. Several researchers are working to try to understand the ecological effects of microplastics across several levels of biological organization. Still, experiments in tanks and mesocosms are difficult to extrapolate to the real world. At IISD-ELA (the Experimental Lakes Area), I propose to do a series of experiments, including a whole lake manipulation, to measure the contamination, fate and ecological impacts of microplastics on aquatic ecosystems.

Therefore, research geared towards understanding factors causing and influencing these diseases is of strategic value. One class of genes frequently mutated in ALS patients encode RNA binding proteins, such as TDP-43 and FUS, which are key regulators of gene expression and nerve cell physiology. The activity of these RNA binding proteins is frequently modified by the actions of other members of the broader RNA binding protein family. The proposed research aims to identify RNA binding proteins that influence the defects caused by mutations in TDP-43 and FUS, using models of the disease established in the tiny roundworm C. elegans.

ER19-15-270,Developing Nanoengineered Bioinks for 3D Bioprinting Complex Osteochondral Tissue Structures ,"Currently available treatment methods to treat musculoskeletal injuries largely depend on invasive techniques, where the drug-carrying prefabricated scaffolds are surgically implanted at defect sites. From clinical perspective, injectable hydrogels are preferred over prefabricated scaffolds due to their minimally invasive nature. This procedure has much lower risk of infection, blood loss and surgical scar formation. Furthermore, injectable hydrogels can fill up any desired shape and hence can be used to treat irregular defects.
However, weak mechanical properties of currently available injectable hydrogels result in limited control over structural stability, printability and degradation characteristics. Proposed research will introduce a novel family of nanocomposite hydrogels to strengthen the weak hydrogel networks. The formulated hydrogels will be mechanically resilient, 3D printable, and capable of delivering therapeutic molecules and cells. Additionally, the hydrogel will be used as bioinks to print complex osteochondral tissue structures for growing number of osteoarthritis patients who needs joint regeneration/replacement.",Advanced Health Technologies,Early Researcher Awards - Round 015,22-Dec-20,Early Researcher Awards,The University of Western Ontario,London,"$140,000","$190,000","biomaterials, nanomedicine, nanomaterials, tissue engineering, hydrogels, regenerative medicine",Operating,Arghya,Paul

It is estimated that 3.6 million Canadians are living with at least one neurological disorder with over 60,000 people in Ontario diagnosed annually. Genome sequencing technology has allowed detection of causal genetic factors in a subset of these disorders, but the causes underlying most of the cases remain unknown. We hypothesize this is due to the neglection of repetitive DNA regions, which constitute most of our genetic information. Currently, there are over 50 genetic disorders linked to abnormality in repetitive sequence. They are mostly caused by increased length of the repeats (repeat expansions). We will develop and apply novel analytical strategies to discover disease-relevant repeat expansions, their modifying factors, and delineate their involvement in neurological disorders.

I propose that one powerful barrier to systemic change is rooted in White individualsâ€™ emotional reactions to considering their role in racism and inequality. They often experience such moments as distressing and although this distress could motivate them to take action against racism, people are commonly motivated to reduce this distress in the service of a powerful instinct to protect well-being. In turn, a striking trade-off emerges: people protect their well-being but impair their motivation to address racism. The proposed research will systematically investigate this trade-off and identify strategies that may be effective for promoting both well-being and collective action.

The progress Dr. Moursi and her team make will be of significant interest for scientists employing splitting methods and for the industrial and healthcare sectors, since the functions used to model industrial problems are often nonconvex. On the other hand, HQP working on this research will acquire a strong analytic and computational foundation. 
Both aspects will significantly contribute to Ontarioâ€™s leading role in sciences and industr",Technological development for social purposes,Early Researcher Awards - Round 016,23-Mar-22,Early Researcher Awards,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,"$140,000","$190,000",,Operating,Walaa,Moursi
ER21-16-304,Quantum Simulations of Fundamental Particle Interactions,"The standard model of particle physics is the bedrock for our understanding of Nature. Numerical simulations of subatomic physics are restricted due to inherent limitations of classical computers to simulate quantum properties. Thus, there is an inescapable need to find new methods to address numerous open fundamental questions. Quantum computers can in principle overcome these roadblocks. However, to reap the rewards of this opportunity requires the development of new quantum simulation tools for so-called gauge theories which underlay the standard model.

Dr. Muschik will develop the theoretical concepts to build these new types of quantum simulators, she will work with experimental partners on proof-of-concept demonstrations, and she will employ hybrid quantum-classical simulations that benefit from on machine learning.

By applying quantum technology to problems in particle physics, she will bridge two strong fields in Ontario, while establishing industry connections for knowledge transfer with Google and IBM.",Technological development for social purposes,Early Researcher Awards - Round 016,23-Mar-22,Early Researcher Awards,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,"$140,000","$190,000",,Operating,Christine,Muschik
ER21-16-310,Partial readout of quantum information using trapped ions,"Quantum computing is expected to revolutionize technology. However, a major challenge in building quantum computers is the difficulty of allowing them to make decisions: given this quantum information, what should the computer do next? This difficulty arises from the fact that reading the information that tells the computer which decision to make, often corrupts the remaining quantum data due to fundamental rules of quantum measurement. Dr. Senkoâ€™s team will develop novel techniques to protect some quantum information while other information is being read out. Their work will raise the profile of Ontario as a leader in quantum computing research, by informing the design of next-generation quantum computers that include decision-making capabilitie",Development and creation of investigation spots,Early Researcher Awards - Round 016,23-Mar-22,Early Researcher Awards,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,"$140,000","$190,000",,Operating,Crystal,Senko
ER21-16-311,Structure and algorithms in graph theory,"The proposed research centers around finding efficient algorithms for computational problems in graphs through structural considerations. Graphs are mathematical structures that model relationships in discrete systems, such as computer chips, networks, and power grids. Various resource management problems (such as assigning tasks to workers) can be expressed as problems on graphs; but real-world instances are too complex to be able to compute a solution in practice.

Dr Spirklâ€™s methods rely on analyzing the global effect of forbidden local patterns, a fundamental question in graph theory. Dr Spirklâ€™s team will work to fully classify those local structures that lead to efficient practical algorithms. The team will research and develop a repertoire of problem-solving techniques applicable to both academia and industry. Since local restrictions are frequently found in practical instances, solving them is relevant to many challenges (such as increasing efficiency by obtaining better, faster algorithms) in thchnology sector in Ontario.",Development and creation of investigation spots,Early Researcher Awards - Round 016,23-Mar-22,Early Researcher Awards,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,"$140,000","$190,000",,Operating,Sophie,Spirkl
